## INTRODUCTION APP

### App Walk-though

`TODO://` Add the URL to your animated app walk-though `gif` in the image tag below. Make sure the gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (☝️ Remove this paragraph after after adding gif). LICEcap is a great tool for recording and you can simply upload the gif to GitHub and provide the path name in place of URL as shown below.

### Required Features

### Optional Features

- [x] 1. There is an additional text field that the user type in to provide their major/area of study. writing in that text field will also add into the introduction message
- [x] 2. One style issues I had was selecting multiple textboxes and have the verticle distance between all of them be equal. I got a little familiar with Visual Basic awhile back and wanted a system similar to them, you could select multiple objects and make it to where the space(verticle or horizontal) between all of them matched perfectly.I'm sure there is a way but I just couldnt find it.
